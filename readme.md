# Tim Roughgarden's CS161 - python code

A set of (alphabetically ordered) implementations of some of the algorithms discussed in Tim Roughgarden's online course (highly recommended if you haven't taken it). These were a 2020 lockdown project. I haven't provided a lot of explanatory text but hopefully these might be helpful for someone.
